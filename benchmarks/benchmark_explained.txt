This file contains benchmark tests for SPECTRUM.

- DIPOLE FIELD VISUALIZATION
   - File: main_test_dipole_periods.cc
   - Trajectory type: any
   - Field type: dipole
   - Expected result: The magnetic field components (outputted in separate files) should resemble a dipole field along a 2D cross-section containing the dipole axis. Specifically, the dipole is along the z-axis, and the cross-section is at y=0. Therefore, By = 0.

- DIPOLE FIELD DRIFT PERIODS
   - File: main_test_dipole_periods.cc
   - Trajectory type: guiding
   - Field type: dipole
   - Expected result: The printed theoretical and simulated bounce and drift periods should match (within a few percent).
   - Notes: The bounce period is estimated two different ways, first using the number of equatorial plane crossings, and second using the number of mirrorings. The drift period is estimated using the number of meriodinal plane crossings. The bounce period calculation should be accurate on both guiding and lorentz trajectories but the drift period will only work reliably for the guiding trajectories, since the gyromotion of the lorentz trajectory produces multiple crossings of the meridional plane for every single crossing of the gyrocenter.

- PITCH ANGLE DISTRIBUTION ISOTROPIZATION
   - File: main_test_pa_distro_isotrop.cc
   - Trajectory type: guiding_scatt
   - Field type: Uniform
   - Expected result: An initial pitch angle distribution (Dirac) should isotropize with time. All stochastic pitch angle methods should give roughly the same behavior.

- PITCH ANGLE SCATTERING
   - File: main_test_pa_scatt.cc
   - Trajectory type: guiding_scatt
   - Field type: Uniform
   - Expected result: E[z] = 0, and E[z^2] = 2*K_z*t, with K_z = v^2/(6*D0)
   - Notes: The diffusive behavior in z arises after an initial period of ballistic movement. Larger values of D0 will produce shorter ballistic periods, but will take longer to run due to a greater restriction on the time step. E[z] will not be exactly zero but will hover around it with values that may seem large, but the result can be verified via E[z]^2 << E[z^2].

- PERPENDICULAR DIFFUSION
   - File: main_test_perp_diff.cc
   - Trajectory type: guiding_diff
   - Field type: Uniform
   - Expected result: E[x] = E[y] = 0, and E[x^2] = E[y^2] = 2*K_p*t, with K_p = D0
   - Notes: Same note about relative magnitude of first and second moments as in "PITCH ANGLE SCATTERING" applies here.

- FULL DIFFUSION
   - File: main_test_full_diff.cc
   - Trajectory type: parker
   - Field type: Uniform
   - Expected result: E[x] = E[y] = 0, and E[x^2] = E[y^2] = E[z^2] = 2*K*t, with K = D0
   - Notes: Same note about relative magnitude of first and second moments as in "PITCH ANGLE SCATTERING" applies here.

- TURBULENCE VIA SUPERPOSITION OF WAVES
   - File: main_test_turb_waves.cc
   - Trajectory type: fieldline
   - Field type: waves
   - Expected result: Plot trajectories that are characteristic to each type of turbulence.
   - Notes: The A modes should oscillate sharply around a constant magnetic field line (in the z-direction). The T modes should trace closed loops when collapsed to the xy-plane. The L modes should trace straight lines in the z direction. The I modes are similar to the A modes but they are more wobbly (instead of sharp turns) and potentially wonder off their initial magnetic field line.

- PARKER SPIRAL SOLAR WIND
   - File: main_test_parker_spiral.cc
   - Trajectory type: fieldline
   - Field type: solarwind
   - Expected result: The trajectory should trace the Parker spiral magnetic field.
   - Notes: Make sure that "SOLARWIND_CURRENT_SHEET" is  (#)defined as 0 in src/background_solarwind.hh.

- INITIAL CONDITION RECORDS TEST
   - File: main_test_init_cond_records.cc
   - Trajectory type: focused
   - Field type: uniform
   - Expected result: The records outputed to the "output_data" folder should contain a list of positions uniformly distributed over a sphere with a radius of 1AU, which corresponds to the initial distribution of particle positions.

- MODULATION WITH CARTESIAN PARKER SPIRAL
   - File: main_test_modulation_cartesian_parker.cc
   - Trajectory type: parker
   - Field type: cartesian
   - Expected result: An initial spectrum given by a power law in differential density should be modulated through a uniformly discretized parker spiral (via a cartesian background). The auxiliary file 'main_postprocess_modulation_cartesian_parker.cc' post-processed the data to differential intensity and outputs it to 'test_modulation_cartesian_TrajectoryParker_spectrum_pp.dat' along with an approximate theoretical solution given by Fisk & Axford (1969). The solutions should match well with perhaps a small discrepancy at low energies but very good agreement at high energies.
   - Notes: Make sure that "DISTRO_KINETIC_ENERGY_POWER_LAW_TYPE" is (#)defined as 0 in src/distribution_other.hh. In addition, all server units must match spectrum fluid units, and the "SERVER_VAR_INDEX_" for "FLO", "MAG", and "ELE" must be set to 0, 3, and 6, respectively, in src/server_base.hh. Also, "block_size_cartesian" should be set to (4,4,4) in src/reader_cartesian.hh, and "n_variables_cartesian" must be set to 9 in src/block_cartesian.hh. Finally, the line (#)defining "TRAJ_PARKER_USE_B_DRIFTS" must be commented out in src/trajectory_parker.hh.
